          <h3>MiniBio</h3>
          <p>I'm currently a student at Eastern Washington University, studying visual communication and design. I used to be on the path to becoming an anesthesiologist, and one day I decided to forgoe the money and chase the happiness. I'm lucky enough to have a sort of natural talent for making things look nice (says family and friends), but learning through design courses has taken it to a whole new level for me, and I'm absolutely happy with the path that I'm finally walking down in life. I look forward to seeing where this career choice can go for me.
          I also work at Jimmy John's - they love me there, and drive for Lyft on my spare time. I love playing open-world games, as well as exploring the real world in my home state of Washington. </p>

        <h3>Design Skills</h3>
        <p>I'm getting pretty handy with Adobe Illustrator, and can also use Photoshop.
        My typhography skills are under construction, as are my Web Designing skills. I can freehand draw anytime. So far I feel like I am pretty good at coming up with unique things, but I do love some good inspirational Google searches HAH!</p>

        <h3>Personal Style</h3>
        <p>I'm actually having trouble identifying it, but it's early in the game. I guess I have yet to develop one... I like trying EVERYTHING right now, I guess... :D</p>

        <h3>My name...</h3>
        <h2>Madeline Christine Brine</h2>
        <p>My mother insists that it was not intentional to end my first, middle, and last names in "ine" like that. Yeah right, Mom, you did it on purpose!</p>
